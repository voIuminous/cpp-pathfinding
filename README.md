# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

This project demonstrates how A* efficiently finds the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles.

## Usage

- **Left Click**: Place walls/obstacles
- **Starting Position**: Blue square (preset)
- **Target Position**: Red square (preset)
- The path will automatically update whenever obstacles are placed

## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n is the number of nodes
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing nodes in the open and closed sets
